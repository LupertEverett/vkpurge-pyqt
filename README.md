# vkpurge-pyqt
This little program is basically just a GUI wrapper/frontend for the [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) tool named [vkpurge](https://man.voidlinux.org/vkpurge.8). It is built using Python with PyQt5, and is made out of curiosity.

This project is not affiliated with Void Linux in any way.
